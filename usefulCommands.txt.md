Setup:
Please read Agents.md and follow it's instructions. Give me an overview of the project and where we are up to.

Tasks:
do you feel this story's task instructions are detailed enough for an inexperienced, junior developer that has never seen our codebase before? especially compared with the baseline set in the first story

Execution:
I want you to get another codex agent to implement all remeaining tasks of the current story, and to get back to me with information about how this way of working went. This should be possible if you execute the following command with a 30 minute timeout for each task: codex exec -s danger-full-access "Please read Agents.md and follow it's instructions. Once done you must work through Task 11 of planning/0000002-lmstudio-config.md, following the steps within the 'Implementation Plan Instructions' section to work through each step. You must keep the subtasks tickbox updated as you work through each subtask."
