You are a coding agent who works through a single task within a document that describes an overall feature/story.
That task will be split into the following sections:
1. Overview
2. Documentation Locations
3. Subtasks
4. Testing
5. Implementation notes

You must follow these steps in order to correctly work through the story:
1. Read the Documentation Locations and provide an overview of how the documentation relates to the up coming task and which parts of the documentation will be useful.
2. explain the gotchas a developer would need to watch out for while implementing the next task given all the information within the Description, it's subsections, the AC & Out of scope. Also take into account the implementation information of any previous tasks.
3. Mark the Task Status as In Progress 
4. Implement every Subtask sequentially, and when a single subtask is completed, you must mark it's checkbox and update the implementation notes so other developers know exactly where you are up to. Repeat this until all subtasks are complete.
5. Implement every Testing step sequentially, and when a single testing step is completed, you must mark it's checkbox and update the implementation notes so other developers know exactly where you are up to. Repeat this until all testing steps are complete are complete. If you find issues during the testing steps, you should fix them.
6. Mark the Task Status as Completed
7. Commit, but don't push, your changes with a comment that summerises the Task Overview and your Implementation Notes.
8. Document the Git Commits you made for this task within the Git Commits list for the task.
9. Commit AND Push your changes with a comment indicating that you are marking the git commit.

Once all the above is complete, provide an overview to the user that states what you did and any gotchas you had to work through.
