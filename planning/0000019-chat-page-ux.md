# Story 0000019 – Chat page UX improvements (bulk conversation actions + live streaming across conversations)

## Implementation Plan Instructions

This story follows `planning/plan_format.md`.

Follow `planning/plan_format.md` (update Task Status before coding; work tasks in order; run required tests; update docs; record commits; push at each stage).

Story convention (important for this repo’s planning style):
- Each task’s **Documentation Locations** section must contain **external** references only (website docs, Context7 library docs, MUI MCP docs, Deepwiki MCP docs when available).
- Any repo file paths that must be read/edited belong in the relevant **Subtask** under “Files to read” / “Files to edit”.

## Description

Right now, the Chat page conversation sidebar is optimized for single-conversation workflows. Users can only archive/restore one conversation at a time, and filtering is limited to a single “Show archived” toggle. This makes common housekeeping (cleaning up many chats, focusing only on archived items, restoring multiple items) unnecessarily slow.

Separately, live streaming in the GUI is scoped to the active request that started the chat. If a conversation is streaming in one browser window and the user views the same conversation in another window (or switches between conversations while multiple runs are in progress), the other view does not receive the live token/tool/final updates in real time. This prevents a “multi-conversation dashboard” workflow and makes agent/MCP-initiated runs feel second-class when viewed in the UI.

This story improves the Chat page UX in two ways:

1. **Bulk conversation management**: allow multi-select and bulk actions (archive / restore / permanent delete) with a clearer 3-state conversation filter (`Active`, `Active & Archived`, `Archived`).
2. **Live conversation streaming everywhere**: any in-progress conversation (started via REST/Web UI, or via MCP) can be viewed from any browser window; switching between conversations shows a snapshot of the conversation so far and continues receiving updates for that conversation while it streams.

The intended approach for “catch-up” is:
- The client continues to load the persisted snapshot (existing “load turns for a conversation” mechanism).
- While a conversation is actively streaming, the server provides incremental updates for the current in-flight turn from in-memory state.
- The UI merges persisted turns with the in-memory streaming turn so the transcript reflects “so far” content without requiring the server to retain full histories in memory.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Conversation sidebar – filter + multi-select

- Users can switch the conversation list view between:
  - `Active` (default)
  - `Active & Archived`
  - `Archived`
- Users can select multiple conversations in the sidebar (multi-select).
- When viewing `Active` or `Active & Archived`, users can bulk archive the selected conversations.
- When viewing `Archived`, users can bulk restore the selected conversations.
- When viewing `Archived`, users can bulk **permanently delete** the selected conversations:
  - Deletion is a **hard delete** (no retention window / audit log requirement in v1).
  - Deletion removes **both** the conversation record and all stored turns/tool calls for that conversation.
  - Deletion requires an explicit user confirmation (confirmation dialog) before the server is called.
- Bulk actions are **all-or-nothing**: if any selected conversation cannot be processed, the server rejects the entire bulk request and no changes are applied.
- For v1, bulk actions apply to the currently loaded conversations in the list (no “select all matches across pagination”).

### Chat streaming – snapshot + live updates across conversations/windows

- When a conversation is opened in the Chat page, the UI shows a snapshot of the conversation so far (existing persisted turns behaviour).
- If that conversation is currently streaming, the UI shows live updates (tokens/tool events/final) for the in-progress turn.
- A user can switch between conversations and see the correct live stream for whichever conversation is actively streaming.
- If the same conversation is viewed in multiple browser windows, both windows receive the same live updates while the run is in progress.
- In-progress MCP conversations stream in the UI the same way as REST/Web conversations (without changing MCP message formats or MCP tooling behaviour).

### Reliability/consistency

- Live streaming updates are tied to a `conversationId` so updates are routed to the correct transcript.
- The server only retains in-memory streaming state for conversations that are currently streaming, and it is released promptly after completion/abort.
- If the user loads a conversation that is not streaming, the UI does not show a streaming placeholder (snapshot-only).

## Out Of Scope

- “Select all” across the entire result set (server-side bulk operations over all matches).
- Complex selection gestures (shift-click ranges, keyboard navigation) beyond basic multi-select.
- Editing conversation titles, tagging, folders, or search within conversations.
- Cross-instance fan-out or locking (multi-server coordination). v1 assumes a single server process for live fan-out.
- Changing the MCP tool request/response formats or the persisted MCP turn schema. This story only improves how those existing turns/streams are displayed in the browser.
- Introducing an explicit “cancel run” endpoint for non-UI initiated runs (cancellation remains via existing abort/disconnect mechanisms where applicable).

---

## Questions

- Live streaming transport:
  - Prefer Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket for conversation event fan-out? (SSE is simpler, but we should align with existing patterns and infra.)
- Catch-up precision for in-flight turns:
  - Is it sufficient to provide “current assistant content so far” only (tokens), or do we need to include interim tool-call progress events as well?
  - Do we need replay/sequence IDs for clients that connect late, or is “snapshot + current partial turn buffer” enough?
- Subscription scope:
  - Should the client subscribe to all active streams by default (so switching is instant), or subscribe/unsubscribe per conversation and accept a small delay on switch?
