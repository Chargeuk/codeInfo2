            "Chat_Input": "Check if all the changes needed to implement this new logic are correctly documented within the story. For example, do any of the tasks make assumptions that are incorrect, or have reliance on logic that isn't there? Will the interfaces into the system be able to actually do what we want them to do because the server has exposed the correct informaiton and input logic? Will existing functionality break because we have planned changes that have consequences we didn't consider? Do we have open questions represented by investigation subtasks, because if so those investigations should be performed now so the story becomes a concrete set of tasks. Use the code_info mcp tools to search the repository multiple times as well as performing manual searches. Update the plan and tasks based on what you find."

            "Chat_Input": "Use the code_info, Context7, deepwiki & mui MCP servers to check that any assumptions made about library usage, interfaces, componbents, etc... are valid and up-to-date based on the version of the libraries being used. Note that if the library is available in code_info, then it is likely to be the correct version of the library and information from there should superseede other MCP servers. You MUST use the tools, never make assumptions, even for things like React, Typescript, Mongo, Mongoose, etc... Update the plan and tasks based on what you find."
