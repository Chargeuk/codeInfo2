# Agent Workflow Guide

## Required Onboarding
- Before doing anything else, read the latest `readme.md`, the `./planning/plan_format.md` overview, and the `design.md` then view the last 3 commits to the repository and give an overview of the project, what was last implemented, and what is to be implemented next.
- Re-read these files at the start of each session; assume they may have changed since your last context window.
- When working in React, use the MUI MCP tool for all Material UI references. For any other APIs or SDKs, consult documentation via the Context7 MCP tool so guidance stays current.

## Branching & Phase Flow
- Create a feature branch for each story (`feature/<index>-<short-description>`) from the currently checked out loction.
- Work only within that branch until every task in the story is complete and working.
