# Story 0000045 – Command And Flow Reingest And Codeinfo Markdown Steps

## Implementation Plan

This is a list of steps that must be followed whilst working on a story. The first step of any plan is to copy this file to a new markdown document that starts with an index padded with zeroes starting at 1 and the title of the story. eg: ./planning/0000001-initial-skeleton-setup.md
Create (or reuse if it already exists) the feature branch for this phase using the established naming convention (for example `feature/<number>-<Title>`).
The Description, Acceptance Criteria & Out Of Scope sections must be fully documented to the point where a very junior, inexperienced developer who has never seen the product before would be able to read and understand what we want to do and why.
The Questions sections should be populated by an AI at the start of the planning phase, as soon as the initial description is provided. As these questions get answered, the questions should be removed and relevent information should be added to the other sections. The Questions section must be empty before creating tasks.

### Description

Command JSON files and flow JSON files already let users automate multi-step agent work, but two important workflow needs are still missing.

The first missing need is repository re-ingest as part of a workflow. Users can manually re-ingest a repository today, but they cannot place that action inside a command or flow and guarantee that the next workflow step will wait until re-ingest has actually finished. This makes it awkward to build update-and-research workflows because the next AI step may run before the repository search index is ready.

The second missing need is reusable long-form markdown input. Current command and flow `llm`-style steps are built around message arrays, which is fine for short prompts but awkward for large, curated instructions. Users want to place markdown files into a predictable repository folder and reference them from commands and flows without the system trimming, rewriting, or otherwise reformatting the markdown before it is passed to the AI agent.

This story adds both capabilities, but keeps them within the existing synchronous runner model. It does not introduce paused execution or user-interactive waiting. Each new step must run to a terminal outcome before the runner decides what to do next.

For commands, this story keeps the existing top-level `Description + items[]` file shape for backward compatibility. To keep the implementation simple, the existing command `message` item continues to be the command-side LLM step. This story does not add a second command item type that means "run an LLM step". Instead, it adds one new command item type for re-ingest and extends the existing `message` item so it can load its instruction from either `content` or `markdownFile`.

For markdown files, the user has chosen a repository-level folder named `codeinfo_markdown`, similar to repository `flows` support. Markdown files must be resolved using deterministic repository priority rules instead of ad hoc relative paths:

- same source repository as the running flow or repository-scoped command;
- then the codeInfo2 repository;
- then other ingested repositories sorted by case-insensitive source label and then case-insensitive full source path.

For local-only command execution where there is no separate repository source, the same-source and codeInfo2 repository collapse to the same location in the codeInfo2 repository.

Current repository evidence shows that direct command runs do not currently carry a repository `sourceId` the way flows do. To keep this story small and aligned with the existing runner contracts, direct command execution resolves `markdownFile` from the codeInfo2 repository only. Repository-aware command markdown fallback is supported when a command is executed from inside a flow, because the flow already owns the repository context and deterministic repository ordering.

Within `codeinfo_markdown`, this story supports safe relative subpaths such as `architecture/auth/login.md`. Absolute paths, `..` traversal, and any lookup that escapes the resolved `codeinfo_markdown` root remain forbidden.

For re-ingest steps, the story reuses the server’s existing blocking re-ingest behavior. The step must wait until ingest finishes with a terminal status such as completed, cancelled, or error before the runner may continue. If re-ingest fails, the command or flow still continues to the next step, but the step result must be recorded in a structured way so users and later debugging can see exactly what happened.

This story deliberately excludes user-input waiting. That will be handled in a later story because it requires a new paused/resumable run state rather than a normal synchronous step.

### Concrete Contracts

The following concrete contracts define the intended output of this story. They are here so a junior developer can see the target shapes and behaviors before any tasking is created.

#### Command File Contract

Command files keep the current top-level shape:

```json
{
  "Description": "Refresh the repository index and run the review prompt.",
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "reingest",
      "sourceId": "/workspace/repository"
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "markdownFile": "architecture/review.md"
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "content": ["Summarize the main risks in three bullets."]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for command items:

- `Description` keeps its existing capital `D` field name.
- `items` stays the executable array. This story does not rename it to `steps`.
- `message` remains the existing command LLM item shape.
- A `message` item must contain exactly one instruction source:
  - `content: string[]`; or
  - `markdownFile: string`.
- A `message` item must never contain both `content` and `markdownFile`.
- `role` remains fixed to `user` for command `message` items.
- A new `reingest` item is added with the shape `{ "type": "reingest", "sourceId": "<absolute-ingested-root>" }`.

#### Flow File Contract

Flow files keep the current top-level shape:

```json
{
  "description": "Refresh the repository index and run the review prompt.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "reingest",
      "label": "Refresh repository index",
      "sourceId": "/workspace/repository"
    },
    {
      "type": "llm",
      "label": "Architecture review",
      "agentType": "planning_agent",
      "identifier": "architecture-review",
      "markdownFile": "architecture/review.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules for flow steps:

- Existing `llm`, `command`, `break`, and `startLoop` shapes stay valid unless this story explicitly extends them.
- A flow `llm` step must contain exactly one instruction source:
  - `messages: FlowMessage[]`; or
  - `markdownFile: string`.
- A flow `llm` step must never contain both `messages` and `markdownFile`.
- A new `reingest` flow step is added with the shape `{ "type": "reingest", "sourceId": "<absolute-ingested-root>", "label"?: string }`.

#### Markdown Resolution Contract

`markdownFile` is always a path relative to a repository-level `codeinfo_markdown` folder. The resolver behavior is:

1. Validate the requested path.
2. Reject empty values, absolute paths, `..` traversal, and any normalized path that would escape `codeinfo_markdown`.
3. Build candidate repositories in this order:
   - same source repository as the running flow or repository-scoped command;
   - the codeInfo2 repository;
   - other ingested repositories sorted case-insensitively by source label and then by full source path.
4. For each candidate, look for `<candidate-root>/codeinfo_markdown/<markdownFile>`.
5. If the file is missing in that candidate, move to the next candidate.
6. If the file exists but cannot be read, is invalid UTF-8, or fails path validation for that candidate, fail the step immediately instead of silently falling through to another repository.
7. Use the first successfully read file and pass its bytes through as UTF-8 text exactly as read.

For local-only command execution where there is no separate repository source, "same source repository" and "codeInfo2 repository" mean the same codeInfo2 checkout, so no ambiguous ordering is introduced.

#### Re-Ingest Step Result Contract

The re-ingest step uses the same `sourceId` contract as the existing blocking re-ingest service: it is the exact absolute repository root path of an already ingested repository, not a display label and not a relative path.

Once a re-ingest step starts, it must always finish with a structured terminal result that includes at least:

```json
{
  "stepType": "reingest",
  "sourceId": "/workspace/repository",
  "status": "completed",
  "runId": "ingest-run-id",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

The exact storage location can follow the existing command/flow run result patterns, but the information above must be recorded in a structured form for later inspection. Terminal statuses of `completed`, `cancelled`, and `error` are non-fatal to the overall command or flow once the step has started. By contrast, invalid step configuration should still fail validation before the run starts.

The existing blocking re-ingest service already collapses ingest status `skipped` into terminal step status `completed`. This story keeps that behavior instead of introducing a fourth public terminal step status.

`markdownFile` content is always treated as one user instruction string after the file is read. The system does not parse markdown into multiple chat messages, frontmatter fields, or a richer prompt DSL as part of this story.

### Research Findings And Scope Guardrails

The following points come from direct inspection of the current repository plus external documentation research. They narrow the story to the smallest implementation that fits the existing code.

- The repository currently uses `zod` `3.25.76`. The package does not expose `z.xor`, so XOR validation in this story should be implemented with explicit object unions or `superRefine`, not by depending on a newer upstream API.
- `server/src/agents/commandsRunner.ts` currently retries every command item through `runWithRetry(...)`. Re-ingest steps should be excluded from retry injection and retried AI prompts. They should execute once, record their terminal result, and then continue or fail validation according to the normal step contract.
- `server/src/flows/service.ts` currently executes flow `llm` steps by iterating `step.messages`. The markdown-file branch therefore needs to resolve to a single instruction string executed once, not to an array of derived messages.
- Node.js string decoding does not guarantee that invalid UTF-8 bytes will throw during normal `'utf8'` reads. If this story promises that invalid UTF-8 markdown fails clearly, the implementation must read raw bytes and decode them with strict UTF-8 error handling instead of relying on permissive string conversion.
- Flow repository ordering already exists in the codebase and is deterministic. This story should reuse that ordering logic rather than inventing a second repository-priority implementation for markdown loading.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Command JSON keeps the existing top-level shape `{ "Description": string, "items": [...] }`. This story does not replace command files with a top-level `steps` array.
- Command JSON adds exactly one new executable item type for this story: `{ "type": "reingest", "sourceId": "<absolute-ingested-root>" }`.
- Command JSON keeps the existing `message` item for LLM execution and extends that item so it accepts exactly one instruction source:
  - `content: string[]`; or
  - `markdownFile: string`.
- A command `message` item that provides both `content` and `markdownFile`, or neither of them, fails schema validation.
- Flow JSON keeps the existing top-level shape `{ "description"?: string, "steps": [...] }`.
- Flow JSON adds exactly one new executable step type for this story: `{ "type": "reingest", "sourceId": "<absolute-ingested-root>", "label"?: string }`.
- Flow JSON keeps the existing `llm` step shape and extends it so it accepts exactly one instruction source:
  - `messages: FlowMessage[]`; or
  - `markdownFile: string`.
- A flow `llm` step that provides both `messages` and `markdownFile`, or neither of them, fails schema validation.
- The `sourceId` field used by re-ingest steps means the exact absolute root path of an already ingested repository, matching the current blocking re-ingest service contract.
- When a command or flow reaches a re-ingest step, the runner does not start the next step until the blocking re-ingest call has reached one of the terminal statuses `completed`, `cancelled`, or `error`.
- Once a re-ingest step has started successfully, any of the terminal statuses `completed`, `cancelled`, or `error` is recorded as a structured step result and does not stop the rest of the command or flow from continuing.
- The structured re-ingest result records at least the step type, sourceId, terminal status, ingest run id, and any available error code.
- Re-ingest step execution is single-attempt. It does not participate in AI retry prompt injection and does not automatically trigger a second re-ingest run after a terminal result.
- Markdown file contents are read from UTF-8 files and passed to the AI agent verbatim, with no trimming, newline rewriting, whitespace cleanup, or prompt reformatting.
- Invalid UTF-8 markdown bytes fail with a clear step error rather than being silently replaced or normalized.
- `markdownFile` values are always resolved under a repository-level `codeinfo_markdown` directory and may include safe relative subpaths such as `architecture/auth/login.md`.
- Absolute paths, empty paths, `..` traversal, and any normalized path that would escape `codeinfo_markdown` fail validation with a clear step error.
- Markdown resolution order for repository-scoped execution is deterministic:
  - same source repository first;
  - codeInfo2 repository second;
  - other ingested repositories last, sorted case-insensitively by source label and then by full source path.
- Direct command execution without a flow-owned repository context resolves `markdownFile` from the codeInfo2 repository only.
- When a command is executed as a flow command step, markdown resolution inside that command uses the parent flow's repository ordering and same-source repository context.
- If the requested markdown file is missing in the same-source repository, the resolver falls back to codeInfo2 and then to the sorted list of other repositories.
- If a candidate repository contains the requested markdown file but the file cannot be read successfully, the step fails immediately instead of silently falling through to a lower-priority repository.
- Local-only command execution resolves `codeinfo_markdown` from the codeInfo2 repository and does not invent a separate same-source repository.
- Existing command `message` behavior using `content: string[]` continues to work unchanged when `markdownFile` is not used.
- Existing flow `llm` behavior using `messages: FlowMessage[]` continues to work unchanged when `markdownFile` is not used.
- `markdownFile` content is executed as one user instruction string. This story does not expand a markdown file into multiple user messages or additional prompt structure.
- This story does not add paused execution, resumable workflow state, or user-input waiting.

### Out Of Scope

- Any step that waits for the user to type content during an active run.
- REST or websocket contracts for paused or resumable command/flow execution.
- Accepting repository display labels or fuzzy repository names in re-ingest steps. This story uses exact ingested repository root `sourceId` values only.
- Adding a new direct-command REST or MCP contract that supplies repository `sourceId` just to support cross-repository markdown lookup.
- Free-form filesystem-relative markdown lookup outside of `codeinfo_markdown`.
- Adding a second command-only LLM step type when the existing command `message` item already covers that responsibility.
- Expanding markdown files into multiple message objects, frontmatter-driven prompt behavior, or any other markdown prompt DSL.
- Automatic retries that start a second re-ingest run after a terminal re-ingest result.
- Replacing existing flow command-resolution behavior with a new global resolver order beyond the markdown resolution needed by this story.
- Adding new command or flow step types unrelated to re-ingest or markdown-backed `llm`.
- Changing agent instruction semantics outside of what is required to pass verbatim markdown content.

### Questions

None. The command-file compatibility and markdown-path decisions are now fixed for this story.

## Implementation Ideas

- Extend `server/src/agents/commandsSchema.ts` so command `items` become a discriminated union of:
  - existing `message` items, now with XOR validation between `content` and `markdownFile`;
  - new `reingest` items.
- Extend `server/src/flows/flowSchema.ts` with:
  - existing `llm` steps, now with XOR validation between `messages` and `markdownFile`;
  - new `reingest` steps;
  - unchanged `command`, `break`, and `startLoop` steps.
- Because this repository is on `zod` `3.25.76`, implement XOR validation with explicit schema refinement or object unions rather than relying on `z.xor`.
- Keep command files on `Description + items[]` and evolve `items` in place instead of introducing a new top-level command `steps[]` migration.
- Reuse `server/src/ingest/reingestService.ts` for blocking re-ingest execution instead of reimplementing polling logic in command or flow runners.
- Introduce one shared markdown resolution helper so commands and flows do not drift. That helper should:
  - validate safe relative `markdownFile` paths;
  - build candidate repositories using the existing deterministic flow repository ordering;
  - continue on missing files only;
  - fail immediately on read or decode errors once a candidate file exists;
  - decode markdown with strict UTF-8 handling so invalid bytes raise a clear error;
  - return the exact UTF-8 text without trimming.
- Base repository ordering on the existing deterministic flow repository ordering in `server/src/flows/service.ts`.
- Thread repository context into command markdown resolution only where that context already exists:
  - direct command runs use codeInfo2 only;
  - flow-invoked commands reuse the parent flow repository context.
- Keep the existing command `message.content` path and flow `llm.messages` path untouched for backward compatibility.
- For flows, integrate the new behavior into the existing step execution loop in `server/src/flows/service.ts`.
- For flow `llm` markdown support, resolve the file into one instruction string and run it once through the existing agent-turn execution path.
- For commands, extend the current command runner in `server/src/agents/commandsRunner.ts` while preserving start-step, retry, and cancellation behavior for AI message steps only.
- For command and flow re-ingest steps, bypass AI retry prompt injection and execute one blocking re-ingest call per step.
- Reuse the existing conversation/run result patterns so re-ingest step outcomes are visible in a structured way without inventing a second bespoke status system.
- Add tests for:
  - command schema validation for `message.content` XOR `message.markdownFile`;
  - flow schema validation for `llm.messages` XOR `llm.markdownFile`;
  - direct-command markdown resolution from codeInfo2 when no repository context exists;
  - flow-invoked command markdown resolution using the parent flow repository context;
  - verbatim markdown pass-through;
  - invalid UTF-8 markdown failure;
  - same-source markdown success;
  - codeInfo2 fallback;
  - deterministic other-repository fallback;
  - fail-fast behavior when a higher-priority repository contains the file but reading it fails;
  - blocking re-ingest continuation after completed/cancelled/error outcomes;
  - non-fatal re-ingest terminal-status continuation;
  - underlying ingest `skipped` status surfacing as step status `completed`;
  - re-ingest step executes only once and does not trigger retry prompt injection;
  - pre-run validation failure for invalid re-ingest `sourceId` values.
